title: No scrolling ability with Experience Fragment
date: 2025-01-13

Reference text in the experience fragment is too long for the given style of modal-1 and extends beyond the view. I put the IVA text within the container component so that I could enable scrolling, but even with it enabled, the scroll feature does not function and text does not stay contained within the viewable background.
