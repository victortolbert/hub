After adjusting the column width in the preferences box, the view as an editor will adjust to the specified width, however, when viewed as published, the columns have retained a specified width that is not consistent with any adjustments and doesn't change even after refreshing the page. I have even logged off and back on and the problem persists. Video provided.
