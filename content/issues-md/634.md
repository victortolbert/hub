While creating a button for Overview slide "Study Design and Baseline Characteristics", I am unable to adjust the style to match the based on. The provided styles do not match either. Recommend solution to modify button color and size as well as text styles to support multiple styles of buttons. This will allow any modification to text and design if future request require changes rather than using an image that would have to be collected.
