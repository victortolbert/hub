Currently when no style is selected and an image is added, it is not showing up on the slide. https://cwcm.abbvie.com/editor.html/content/nova/isa/mcs-iae/nova-skyrizi-gastro-binder/overview.html is an example of this.  The main container will properly display the background, but the next container is not displaying it on the Clinical Experience tab. This may be image specific as I can add "Skyrizi-gastro.png", but not "woman in water.png"
