title: Text drops to next line without break
date: 2025-01-30

Attached 3 images. The expectation is that all the text stays on the same line until it requires to wrap to the next line. Results are that the text drops to the next line when the style changes. I have included the code to show no breaks in text and that all the code is within the same paragraph. The display in properties for the text has all the text on the same line, but the display on the slide shows the text dropping to the next line when the font color changes.
Recommend correction so that the text will wrap where required.
