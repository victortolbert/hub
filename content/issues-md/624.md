title: Warning that quantity of components exceeded

While accessing Skyrizi gastro Access and Support slide, I received a warning that the page has exceeded system threshold for components, see attached. The warning states that there is a max of 100 components and that I have authored 122. Concern for me is that I have places where I am currently using an image in place of multiple components. Once we correct some of those limitations, we will need the ability to use more components.
