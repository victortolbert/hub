title: Container Style not available

While authoring the Access slide on the Support tab, there are three containers side-by-side that each have a number centered on the top ribbon. I am unable to duplicate this because AEM will not allow images to overlay and that style of container is not one of the three available styles. ***This will also need to be available for RINVOQ Support Slide.

Added additional style that is not available with attachment labelled "Container style"
