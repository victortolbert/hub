title: Full prescribing information not functioning
date: 2025-01-30

In the template, the link for "Full prescribing information" is not directing user to pdf that is linked in the template. I copied the code from SKYRIZI Derm without the span text. Below is the snippet I used for the link
<a href="/content/dam/skyrizihcpivy/isa/lab-11561lab-07914-skyrizi-uc-rxabbvie.com-uspimgifus-20086179-r2-6-2024.pdf" target="_blank">See accompanying Full Prescribing Information</a>

Expected result is that the user is directed to the pdf for the full prescribing information when selecting the link.
