3 containers withing the Access and Support slide extend beyond the bottom safety bar and are visible above the lower navigation bar without additional padding to cause it to be elongated. This is not consistent with the based on. This also applies to Experience Fragments where the container doesn't fit to the contents.

Recommend to have the container stop at the bottom of the component and for the author to be able to add padding or margin as need to control the height of the container.
