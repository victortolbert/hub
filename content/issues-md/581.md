title: Unable to apply footnotes to each tab of slide
date: 2025-01-14

While building Skyrizi Gastro, multiple slides are using symbol and letter references that only apply for the tab that is being viewed. When the user selects a new tab, it will have the familiar symbols, but when footnotes is selected the information displayed only pertains to the tab being viewed.

If there is an overlap of symbols, perhaps we can change the footnote symbols.
