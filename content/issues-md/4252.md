1. Mismatch of bulleting point as highlighted. Same issue in After Week 16 modal
2. Extra space is there between “maintained” and “at” text in point 1 as highlighted. Same issue in After Week 16 modal
3. Highlighted numbers should be in superscript as per XD file. Same issue in After Week 16 modal

Not sure why the bullet isn't appearing on the second line on the experience fragment (https://cwcm.abbvie.com/editor.html/content/experience-fragments/nova/isa/iae/skyrizi-derm/modals/callouts/overview-ps-callout.html)
