title: Skyrizi Gastro Experience Fragment (NOVA-0003)

I am trying to create an ISI Experience Fragment but cannot edit the template that is provided. It will not allow me to add any components. I emailed AEM Support and followed their recommendations, but still cannot edit that template. They said to re-check if it is a valid page template to use. I don't know how to validate that. I tried to create a new template, but was not able to associate it with properly and it wasn't available for me to use in Skyrizi Gastro.
