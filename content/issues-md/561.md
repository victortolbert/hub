title: Unable to move assets (NOVA-0011)
date: 2025-01-10
---

I tried to move an image to another folder and nothing happened. I was able to grab the image and move a shadow to the folder I selected. The image had a "+" symbol acknowledging the transfer, but once I released the mouse, nothing happened. Recommended action would be to allow moving assets in order to keep content organized.
