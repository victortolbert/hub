title: close button adding gray bkgd

When copying or adding a close button in the experience fragment, there is a gray box that has now been associated with the close button. This just started the week of 1/13. I would like it to go back to how it functioned prior to that. I have included a video for reference where I copy the button from an existing fragment that has no background color and paste it into the new fragment and the program automatically assigns a gray background.
