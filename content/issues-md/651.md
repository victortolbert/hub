Access and Support slide for the Humira tab requires a dual safety and indication component in the safety bar. Currently the safety bar is part of the page template and doesn't allow for an independent safety bar component when a tab is called. The based on also allows for each brand to be individually expanded as shown in the attachment.

Expectation is to be able to have the bottom indications independently expand. This feature will also be seen with other brands such as Rinvoq and is HIGHLY desirable.
