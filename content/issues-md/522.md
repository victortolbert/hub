Full Prescribing Information Shown When Launching ISA.MP4
Open Items:\

#	Summary	Notes

3	How do we control the time period before the close icon appears
4	User cannot scroll the modal to see all the content

5	Close icon not styled

6	The requirement is that the first slide opened shows the forced modal (slides can be rearranged in other presentations). All pages are authored to show the forced modal to satisfy this requirement. There are a couple items:
The Overview slide always shows the modal.
The modal does not appear when launch other slides first; e.g., Humira Access.
