title: Carousel swipe feature (NOVA-0015)

When hiding the arrows of the carousel and enabling the swipe feature, the carousel doesn't respond to anything on desktop. Recommend being able to mimic the swipe feature similar to the scroll feature in the safety bar where the user has to click and drag, so that the carousel will advance
