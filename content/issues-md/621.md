title: Space too large between paragraphs
date: 2025-01-30

Space between paragraphs doesn't seem to change once the font size changes. I have attached 2 examples of this. One is at default text size and the other is at a font size of 12. The space between paragraphs seems much larger with the lower font size. I even tried to define the space as seen below:
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0px; line-height: 13.0px;">SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to risankizumab-rzaa or any of the excipients.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.0px; line-height: 8.0px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0px; line-height: 13.0px;">In the treatment of CD, drug-induced liver injury during induction has been reported. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin levels at baseline and during induction, up to at least 12 weeks of treatment. Monitor thereafter according to routine patient management.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
I included how this visually displays with "text space adjustment" attachment. It didn't seem to change anything.

Expected result would be for the space between paragraphs adjust with the line height of the text.
