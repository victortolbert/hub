title: Layout adjustment not responding (NOVA-0014)
date: 2025-01-10

While trying to size each container to fit content, the layout feature has stopped responding to any movements. Even after refreshing, logging in and out, no change in container widths.

Not entirely sure why I was having that issue, but have not had that issue since. STET this issue and if it happens again, we can address it.
