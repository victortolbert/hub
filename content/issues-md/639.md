title: Table Hyperlink jumps to webpage instead of overlay

While using the hyperlink feature within the IVA Table text, 2 out of 3 hyperlinks are jumping to a webpage instead of just the associated experience fragment.

Expected reaction is to have it just pull up the overlay like it does on the first example.

I have attached a video to show the issue.
