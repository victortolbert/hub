title: 404 error on open (NOVA-0008)
date: 2025-01-10

After successfully creating an Experience Fragment I am prompted with 2 options, "Done" or "Open". When I select "Open" I am redirected to a webpage "404 error". I would expect that once I select "Open" that I am redirected to open the Experience Fragment otherwise my only option should be "done" or "close"
