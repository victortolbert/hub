Rinvoq Gastro slide template is not workable. It doesn't allow me to build within the viewing window, the tab headers are not correct, neither vertical or switch. the one container style forces everything to the right side of the container, as demonstrated in the attached video. I will not be able to match the based on with these issues in addition to the other issues I have added for Rinvoq Gastro. I have also attached what the slide is supposed to look like.
