title: Safety bar expanded background color/ upper corners
date: 2025-01-30
---

When the safety bar is expanded, the upper corners change from round to square. In order to match the based on ISA these corners are square when collapsed (ISAAP-559) and rounded when expanded.

Also when expanded, the background color should remain unchanged from the background color shown when collapsed. These are not available to be changed as an author.

Recommend that these style changes be editable in the future to allow rapid alterations as needed.

This may be 2 different issues, notify me to create new issue if needed.
