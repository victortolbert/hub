title: Style Design in Experience Fragment (NOVA-0010)
date: 2025-01-10

While creating an Overlay using Experience Fragment I am unable to use the preset styles provided for tabs header. I copied over the slide for Study Design & Baseline Characteristics to use the scrolling feature in the experience fragment and made an adjustment and lost the tab styling. When I went to reapply it, there are no styles to choose from. Recommended solution would be to have all styles available to build experience fragment for any indication.
