In the Safety bar when expanded, the "Indications" should be underlined in blue. See attached Figma expanded file. Currently there is no underline. Recommend adding text styling to allow author to make minor style changes to text. This will allow future corrections to be completed more rapidly. Until that feature is available, I am requesting a style change to add a blue line under "Indications" that matches the blue line for "SKYRIZI Safety Consid..."
