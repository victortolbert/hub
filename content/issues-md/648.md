While building the Access slide for local coverage, the formulary data is call for twice. Once for Medical Benefit and the other for Pharmacy Benefit. Both should be tied to the same "Change location button, print plans and email plans. The formulary data is also missing a function of the left and right arrow with a number in between.

Recommend updating the formulary data to use just once button where required and incorporate the arrows with as seen in attachments.
