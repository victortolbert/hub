Issue Summary: Formulary data results should be scrollable if more than six results are returned (see row 321 on Navigational Requirements worksheet). Displaying more than 6 causes the 'main content area' to cover the Footnotes and References overlay links. Although these links are not visible, they are still clickable, making it difficult to use the Change Location feature.
NOTE: The core requirement is to limit the component height. Six results was chosen based on the current font.
Steps to reproduce
Open the Access page https://cwcm.abbvie.com/content/nova/isa/mcs-iae/nova-skyrizi-derm-binder/access.html?wcmmode=disabled
Navigate to the Local tab
Click Change Location
Choose populated area; e.g., Baltimore County in Maryland
Expected Result
Results are scrollable when more than 6 results returned.
Actual Result
Results are not scrollable and the 'main content area' is too tall. Some content is behind the Tabs and some covers the Footnotes and References links.
