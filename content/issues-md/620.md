title: Footnotes for each tab

While authoring the Safety slide, I need to be able to adjust footnotes to correspond to the viewed tabbed. Currently there is only one option available to associate an experience fragment with the footnotes button. Recommend in the properties for the button to be able to assign a tab and associate a modal within that tab.
