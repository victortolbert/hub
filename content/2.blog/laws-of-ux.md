Laws of UX is a collection of best practices that designers can consider when building user interfaces.

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.

### Takeaways

1. An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.
2. People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.
3. Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.
