## An API for your design system

Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with [color](/theme/color) choices, [spacing](/theme/spacing), [typography](/theme/typography), [shadows](/theme/shadow), and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.

#### Build Anything

Because utility classes is so low-level--Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look.

In this video, Dan Mall covers what a design system is and how to identify six different types of design systems.

Design systems are important for any designer, engineer, or product person. This video will help you understand what a design system is and the benefits it offers. After watching, you'll be able to identify what kind of design system you and your teams are working on!

## What Is a UX Engineer?

UX engineers combine front end engineering with UX principles, and frequently collaborate with designers, researchers, and back-end engineers.

A user experience (UX) engineer builds and designs digital products like websites and apps while using UX principles. UX engineers generally deal with the front end of these products—the user-facing parts that people interact with, like the buttons, layouts, and flow of the interfaces. They may work on both engineering teams or design teams, or act as liaisons between the two.

https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-ux-engineer

### What does a UX engineer do, exactly?

As a hybrid between a developer and UX designer, the work of a UX engineer includes both UX principles and engineering tasks. Here’s a breakdown of what a UX engineer can be expected to do:

- **Plan and design web pages and apps**: A UX engineer uses UX principles to create digital products. This can mean using wireframes, prototypes, and design tools to create blueprints for what a website or app will look like.
- **Program the front-end**: UX engineers are unique from UX designers because they can code. A UX engineer will use front-end programming languages like HTML, CSS, or Javascript to create layouts, interactive features, or execute other design ideas.
- **Collaborate with UX and engineering teams**: As a professional with both design and programming abilities, UX engineers often act as the bridge between the two teams. UX engineers can work with designers, back end engineers, and writers to develop products. They may also conduct user testing, A/B testing, and other forms of research in collaboration with the UX team.

UX engineers may find their roles are similar to UX developers, front end developers, product design engineers, or UI engineers, though each can differ slightly.

## What Is a UI Architect?

A UI architect is a technology specialist who works to develop software, specifically by implementing a user interface. A UI architect understands how people use software and use this knowledge, along with their creative skills, to design tools and features needed to make the user experience both efficient and more enjoyable. Job duties include leading and collaborating with user experience designers, engineers, and graphic designers, creating a portal-style framework and innovative UI, conducting research and tests along the development stages, and recommending services or software to strengthen business infrastructure. Qualifications begin with at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field as well as several years of experience.
