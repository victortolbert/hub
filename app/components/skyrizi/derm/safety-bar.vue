      <p>Skyrizi Safety Considerations</p>
      <p>
        SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious
        hypersensitivity reaction to risankizumab-rzaa or any of its excipients.
        Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been
        reported with use of SKYRIZI. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction
        occurs, discontinue SKYRIZI and initiate appropriate therapy
        immediately. SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infection. Instruct
        patients to report signs or symptoms of clinically important infection
        during treatment. Should such an infection occur, discontinue SKYRIZI
        until infection resolves. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection
        prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI. Avoid use of live vaccines
        in SKYRIZI patients.
