In this example, I have before and after images of the code that changes when I adjusted the font size from 20 to 24. It retains both in the code and makes the outcome variable. The goal would be that it only has one font size associated with it and the previous ones disappear."

 ** Write the text.ts config/mapping file that should scrape the following tokens from a Figma Styles (Text). Each text type should define these tokens
 *** typography token (weight, font size, line height, font family)
 *** letter spacing
 *** color
 *** text transform

 ** CSS Export should not prefix a base to these output styles. ex:
